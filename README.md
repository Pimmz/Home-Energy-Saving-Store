HOME ENERGY SAVING STORE

Welcome to the Home Energy Saving Store! The website was designed to help homeowners save energy,  reduce bills,  and combat pollution.  Targeting all eco-conscious individuals, we offer practical solutions for sustainable living. Join us in our commitment to a greener future while also positioning our business as a leader in sustainability, attracting a loyal customer base and fostering long-term profitability.

Here is a link to my project -[HOME ENERGY SAVING STORE](https://home-energy-saving-store-be6e9d82e03c.herokuapp.com)

![Am I Responsive](documentation/readme_images/iam.png)

## User Experience (UX)

When I started the design of the Home Energy Saving Store I wanted to ensure the site was Useful, Useable and Valuable so that it makes the user experience informative and enjoyable. To do this I looked at the five key fundamentals;

Strategy - So the user can discover, Learn, enjoy, interact and get assistance with all things to do with saving energy at home.

Scope - Based on the information from the strategy, the features included emotive images. A Contact Us section so that the users can contact the store about returning a product an item not being delivered or anything else. Plus you can subscribe to the sight to get exclusive offers and news from the store. The Tips and Tricks page enables the user to post a picture of their ideas and suggestions on how to save money from innovative ideas. The FAQ page or frequently asked questions is another area designed to help the users of the site to understand whether certain tasks around the home are beneficial or not.

Structure - This was designed around the user. After speaking with several energy-saving people, So they can contact the store. To be able to post their ideas on how to save money without having to pay for it. Plus an area to read the basics on saving energy for the newer users visiting the site.

Skeleton - As before this was designed around the user which was gained from information supplied by several energy-saving people. This dictated that it would be laid out simply. So that it can be used quickly and efficiently while delivering the most amount of information and receiving help depending on the user's needs.

Surface - I wanted the look of the Home Energy Saving Store to be informative, clear, and concise, with consistent typography and corresponding colours to help them stand out, to easily navigate with emotive pictures that helped to raise awareness about reducing pollution and greenhouse gases to help the environment and save the user money.

Then I sat down and roughly sketched out onto paper what the screens would look like on a mobile, tablet and desktop, This then gave me the basis to start creating the Home Energy Saving Store in Codeanywhere.

<summary>Rough Sketch</summary>

### Colour Scheme

The website primarily features a slick black `#000000` and white `#ffffff` colour scheme, particularly chosen to ensure a striking contrast between backgrounds and text. this deliberate contrast allows the images of the featured products to leap off the page, captivating users and enhancing their appeal, thereby bolstering sales.

To enhance readability and use experience on error pages, contact us, tips and tricks and faq. I've opted for a subtle beige background `#f5f5dc` background paired with crisp black text `#000000` this deliberate contrast not only improves legibility but also contributes to a visually appealing design.

I've used [colorcodes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com) To source my colours.

### Typography

I looked for fonts on Google Fonts, to help me decide as it gave a better visual aid for me to see how they all looked in their different weights. After many hours trying the fonts out, I decided to use Lato all the way through to ensure a good balance, with a consistent look and feel. As a backup, I used sans-serif as it has a great look and then my third choice was serif as a fallback in case the other two weren't available.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all the text and headers.

- [Sans serif](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) was used for the backup font.

## Database Design

- I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Django’s Class-Based Generic Views.
- Below is an example of the model I used for my Tips and Tricks page

```python
class TipsAndTricks(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=True, default='')
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, default='')
    featured_image = CloudinaryField('image', default='placeholder')
    content = models.TextField('Content')
    is_approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True, blank=True, null=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.slug:   
            self.slug = slugify(self.title)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```
- Using Markdown formatting to represent an ERD table the Tips and Tricks model above would look like this:

- Table: **Tips and Tricks**

    | **PK** | **Attribute** | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **PK** | id | Integer | Primary Key |
	| **FK** | title| CharField | unique title of the tip |
    | **PK** | author_id | Foreignkey | Foreign key to user model |
    | **PK** | featured_image| CloudianryField | Image field |
    | **PK** | content | TextField | Content of the tip or trick |
    | **PK** | is_approved | BooleanField | Approval status|
    | **PK** | created_at | DateTimeField | Creation Timestamp |
    | **PK** | slug | SlugField | Uniques slug for url |


I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, and then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/readme_images/agile.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store/issues) served as another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store/issues)

    ![screenshot](documentation/readme_images/open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/readme_images/closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such as Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, which should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit
to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://home-energy-saving-store-be6e9d82e03c.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://home-energy-saving-store-be6e9d82e03c.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:
- [Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [Creating and submitting a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a mockup Facebook business account using the
[Balsamiq template](https://code-institute-org.github.io/5P-Assessments-Handbook/files/Facebook_Mockups.zip)
provided by Code Institute.

I've created my Facebook Business Page. Here is the link link - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61554298768912) 

I've also included a screenshot in case Facebook take down my business page![Facebook](documentation/readme_images/facebook.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in learning more. 

![Newsletter Page](documentation/readme_images/newsletter.png)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's @method_decorator is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the signup page.
- I have also used Django's LoginRequiredMixin to highlight the use of both for class-based views. Which is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the signup page.
- Django's conditional statement {% if user.is_authenticated %} was also used to ensure certain pages were only accessible to logged-in users.

### Form Validation

- If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error.

### Database Security

- The database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to
  Github.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom Error Pages

- Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - Error 400 "Bad Request" Oh No! Looks like you made a bad request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Error 403 "Forbidden Request" Sorry that's a Forbidden request.
- 404 Page Not Found - Error 404 "Not Found" Yikes! That page is Not Found.
- 500 Server Error - Error 500 "Internal Server Error" Oh No! Don't worry its me! not you!

## Testing
  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://home-energy-saving-store-be6e9d82e03c.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### ElephantSQL Database

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: Home-Energy-Saving-Store).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://home-energy-saving-store-be6e9d82e03c.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or Home-Energy-Saving-Store
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Pimmz/Home-Energy-Saving-Store)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!


### Local VS Deployment

When I first deployed the site there was a difference between the local and the deployed site. The issue was the CSS wasn't coming through to the live site. Then I realised that I had committed with Debug set to true. Changing this over to false soon allowed the issue to be rectified
